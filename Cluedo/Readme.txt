This project is based on the Board Game Cluedo (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluedo).

This project is a simplified version of the game with only two players.

The main purpose of this game is to Implement a browser centric Single Page Application (SPA) which efficiently manages DOM manipulation while playing the game. 

When the player enter's their name, a game of guessing begins. Where player and computer each takes a turn.

The game also makes use of browser memory storage to show the history of moves between a player and computer which lasts for the session of that game.
Also, the app will keep a record of all wins and losses between the computer and a player from the first time the game is playerd on a browser.
